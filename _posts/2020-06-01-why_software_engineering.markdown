I have always been interested in why and how. The underlying logic and reasoning that makes our world work, that drives our interactions with other individuals and our environment.

I played a lot of video games growing up. I was drawn towards RPGs. I'm a sucker for storytelling. Eventually, the stories would end, but they didn't have to. I wrote small text-based games in C++ for fun. I was actively engaged in online modding communities, specifically for Knights of the Old Republic back on the old FileFront servers.

I liked developing new stories and writing the code to tell those stories.

Now, I'm a theatre professional. I manage a performing arts venue on a daily basis, and I design sound for live performances. Theatre and all live performance is centered around the performer-audience connection. It is the magic spark that separates live performance from recorded performance. The rush of adrenaline, or the surge of chills throughout your body while Gene Simmons is spouting fake blood from his mouth while he's 30 feet in the air laying down the one of the hardest basslines in music - that is why I love storytelling.

Eliciting an emotional response, be it catharsis, joy, or anything else - that is why I love storytelling.

Software engineering is storytelling. It is the underlying logic and reasoning. It is the why and how.
